Project data (including files and members) was fetched from Firebase when the page loaded. This included filtering files based on the userâ€™s role (owner, editor, or viewer).
To make sure that the interface updated in real-time when files were added/modified, we used Firebase's real-time listeners - storing file metadata (uploader, timestamps) in Firebase for easy retrieval want necessary. 

```
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const projectDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'Projects', decodedProjectName));
    if (projectDoc.exists()) {
      setFiles(projectDoc.data().files || []);
    }
  };
  fetchData();
}, [decodedProjectName]);
```
