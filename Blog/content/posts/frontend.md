With the frontend, our goal was to provide a seamless user interface for uploading, editing and viewing files.
## Tools
Tools that we decided on for the frontend included:
- **React**: for building the application.
- [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/): for real-time database, authentication, and file storage.
- **[IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/)**: for storing file versions.
- **Ethereum**: for tracking file version history.
- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)**: for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **[CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)**: for the in-browser code editor.
