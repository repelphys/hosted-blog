This is the blog documenting the various functions of our application.
We describe:
- The tech stack
- How these functions work, with code examples
- Why we decided on certain implementations over others.

All of this is laid out in bite-sized reading chunks, so we hope that you can follow our process along and see the magic that went into making this application.
